# “Ask A Question” Button (AAQ)
Ask A Question is Flatiron School’s live support for online students. Ask A Question is staffed by Technical Coaches – former graduates who are familiar with the curriculum and ready to help you debug your code and other technical issues. You can also answer other student questions, and are encouraged to do so!

Support from Technical Coaches includes text chat for simple questions and up to a 20 minute pair programming session for more complex cases. While not all issues may be resolved in 20 minutes, we’ve found that, on average, it’s enough time to get you moving again and keep wait times to a minimum for everyone.

We use the Socratic Method on AAQ - asking questions to help guide you to the answer - instead of telling you what to do or giving you the answer. This approach helps students learn and retain information better, as well as making them more adept at debugging on their own. Trust this process.

Technical Coaches provide support Monday through Friday, 9AM to 1AM ET, and Saturday and Sunday, 9AM to 12AM ET, except for holidays. 

You can find more information about Ask A Question and the Technical Coaches in the [Learn.co Help Center](https://help.learn.co/en/).
